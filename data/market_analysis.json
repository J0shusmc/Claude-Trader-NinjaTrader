The anticipated pullback materialized but turned into a significant reversal. NEW bearish FVG formed at 25509.25-25550.50 above, but price action shows strong rejection from that zone. Stochastic at 80.95 (still overbought) with downward momentum confirms bearish pressure. Price now 51pts above EMA21 (25371.08), suggesting further downside likely before any bounce attempt. The previous concern about 'chasing at potential local high' was validated - price has reversed sharply. NO LONG SETUP currently valid. Would need to see: (1) price stabilize and form base, (2) stochastic cool to <50 and turn upward, (3) bullish price action confirmation before considering long entries.",

    "reasoning": "SETUP EVOLUTION CONFIRMED - Previous short setup anticipated this move perfectly. Price dropped 98pts from 25520 to 25422, validating the bearish reversal thesis. NEW FRESH BULLISH FVG formed at 25303.00-25324.25 (0 bars old), now 114pts below current price - this is our magnetic target. STRONG CONFLUENCE: (1) Stochastic remains overbought at 80.95 with sustained downward momentum - PERFECT alignment for continuation. (2) Price rejected from 25520 zone and broke below psychological level 25500, showing commitment to downside. (3) Fresh bullish FVG below acts as strong magnet for gap fill. (4) Price still 51pts above EMA21 (25371.08), providing room for mean reversion. RISK/REWARD: Entry 25422.25, Raw Target 25303.00, Final Target 25308.00 (with 5pt buffer) = 114.25pt profit potential. Stop 25475.00 (52.75pts above entry, positioned above previous resistance zone) = 2.16:1 R/R - EXCELLENT, well above 1.3:1 minimum. MOMENTUM CONFIRMATION: The 98pt drop in one bar shows strong bearish commitment. Stochastic maintaining overbought reading while price drops is classic bearish divergence pattern. PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL: Price now between 25400-25500 levels, with 25400 just 22pts below - likely to break through given momentum. STATUS: READY - All criteria exceeded. Fresh FVG target, excellent R/R (2.16:1), strong momentum alignment, and price action confirmation of reversal. This is the setup we were monitoring, now fully developed and tradeable.",
